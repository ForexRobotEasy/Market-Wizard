## Expert Advisor Description
The Market Wizard Expert Advisor is based on predefined entry and exit criteria. It opens trades when specific conditions are met and closes trades when certain exit conditions are satisfied. The EA is designed to work with the EURUSD symbol and the H1 timeframe.

## Expert Advisor Functions
### Initialization Function
The `OnInit` function is responsible for initializing the expert advisor. It is called once when the EA is attached to a chart. In this function, you can perform any necessary initialization tasks for the EA.

### Deinitialization Function
The `OnDeinit` function is called when the EA is removed from the chart or the terminal is closed. It is responsible for deinitializing the expert advisor and performing any necessary cleanup tasks.

### Start Function
The `OnTick` function is the main function of the expert advisor. It is called on each tick of the selected symbol. In this function, the EA checks if the current symbol and timeframe meet the desired criteria for trading. If the criteria are met, the EA opens trades based on predefined entry conditions. It also checks if any open trades should be closed based on predefined exit conditions.

### Trade Entry and Exit
The `ShouldOpenTrade` function determines if a trade should be opened based on the implemented entry criteria. The `ShouldCloseTrade` function determines if a trade should be closed based on the implemented exit criteria. These functions can be customized to fit the specific trading strategy.

### Lot Size Calculation
The `CalculateLotSize` function is responsible for calculating the lot size for each trade based on the desired risk tolerance. This function can be customized to adjust the trade size according to specific risk management rules.

## Usage
To use the Market Wizard Expert Advisor, follow these steps:
1. Attach the EA to a chart with the EURUSD symbol and the H1 timeframe.
2. Customize the entry and exit criteria in the `ShouldOpenTrade` and `ShouldCloseTrade` functions.
3. Adjust the lot size calculation logic in the `CalculateLotSize` function, if necessary.

Please note that proper backtesting and optimization should be performed before using this EA in a live trading environment. It is recommended to consult with an experienced trader or financial advisor before using any automated trading software.
